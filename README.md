Kalman Filter is an algorithm is under use from the apollo space program era. It was used to put the apollo rocket in the moons gravitational field. It is one of the sought after Localization Algorithms.

Kalman Filter consists of two parts : 
``
Measure_Update- It measures the data swiftly of all the device inputs. Based on probabilistic math.
b)
State Prediction - it is the prediction which the algorithm does based on the previously acquired data.
